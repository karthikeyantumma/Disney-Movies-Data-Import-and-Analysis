Disney Movies Data Import and Analysis
I executed a data import process using Python and Pandas to load Disney movie data into an SQL Server database. The project emphasized skills in data manipulation, database interaction, and Python scripting, culminating in the successful import and initial analysis of the dataset.

Key Achievements:

SQL Server Integration: Created and populated a database table with Disney movie data, utilizing Python and Pandas for data import.
Python Scripting: developed Python scripts to automate the data import process and verify the successful load by retrieving the first 25 records.
Data Management: demonstrated proficiency in managing data flows between file systems and SQL databases, reinforcing strong data engineering and analysis skills.
